&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created an econometrics model of the labor department of the Ministry of National Defence to achieve a quantitative effect of 0.2 billion dollars per year. Being in use since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keywords: military, econometrics, budget projection, dynamic programming, generalized linear model, L2 penalty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-background&#34;&gt;Introduction/Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7dS1sV0VsVUNyYXM&#34; alt=&#34;Intro&#34; /&gt;
In management of military manpower, military retention is a major subject. Policy makers are regulating its size by controlling the rate of retention and re-enlistment and those are closely related to personnel budget since military is a labor-intensive government organization. Most of the countries spent approximately 35% of budget of the total national defense for directly paying it to soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7UXBXMlA2TkQ0ekE&#34; alt=&#34;Problem&#34; /&gt;
One of the main reasons for shorts/overs was the formula for computing total national defence labor expense budget wasn&amp;rsquo;t best formula. The formula uses average salary grade at F year in order to compute F+2 year budget. It also does not adequately reflect existing personnel when organizing F+2 year military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7Z3FIV2s2WU1Tb2c&#34; alt=&#34;Sol&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7dGdXUnFYMVRyeTA&#34; alt=&#34;Sol2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7OFNuRFF2OGIwTkE&#34; alt=&#34;Sol3&#34; /&gt;
We build an econometrics model for predicting retention rate. The model was inspired by the basic context of decision process of whether the person will stay or leave the military. Past studies on related subject have showed that risk aversion is the basic behavior of public servant thus we build the model based on that assumption. The model first compares how much the person will earn if he stays in military and leaves military until retire point ‘T’. Then reflects personal characteristics of personal information such as grades, year of services, promotion candidate, commission background, number of childerns education level, and other 124 factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7VEhGX1FNLVc3dGs&#34; alt=&#34;Sol3&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7a1RzZmU1b2tLems&#34; alt=&#34;Sol4&#34; /&gt;
The proper data manipulation was made based on the Military personnel Law and data from Ministry of Labor. Past 50 years of the Military personnel Law was applied since some of the personal characteristics are closed related such as retirement policy, salary grade policy, promotion policy and etc. Moreover, it is natural to think that soldier will be hired the field where they have devoted in military. We have thus matched 50 occupation speciality to 11 different sectors and applied average salary based on sex and proper salary grades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we added random effect term to induce unbiased estimate of coefficient of the model. Each of the soldier has more than one chance to leave the military. In order to reflect those natural context, we have successfully added random effect in the formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;result&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7eDVsc3EwM1dtXzA&#34; alt=&#34;Sol5&#34; /&gt;
The result of model is out-standing. The classification accuracy of train set is 98.43% which was evaluated by performing 10 rolling origin cross validation and accuracy of ‘out-of-sample’ test set is 97.73%. Decision boundary was chosen at convention level of 0.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;effect&#34;&gt;Effect&lt;/h1&gt;

The forecasting model was completed in 2016 and used from 2016 to measure the 2017 budget. Practitioners are expecting to achieve a quantitative effect of about 0.2 billion dollars per year. This labor cost prediction model project is the first in the Korean government ministries and can be extended to the civil servant area. Especially, the Ministry of Education will be able to see a great effect. It is also a project where three divisions have succeeded in cooperating with each other to break down each closed department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Metrics: MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), MAE (mean absolute error)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimation Technique: IWLS algorithm, EM algorithm, Adaptive Gauss-Hermit Approximation, BLUP, BFGS&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed a model to measure the development pressure and are currently considering applying it in practice at LH Corp., which is , a Public enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Keywords: GIS, econometrics, development pressure, dynamic programming, generalized linear model, L2 penalty
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-background&#34;&gt;Introduction/Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7QU9PaHJORnMzM2s&#34; alt=&#34;Intro&#34; /&gt;
Which area should be developed? The National Assembly is still debating today. One of the most important tasks for LH Corporation, a Public enterprise, is to measure and predict development pressures. The company focuses especially on the development pressure according to the needs of the market, because if the company cannot figure it out, there will be cases where it is necessary to build an apartment or build a road. For this reason, it is very important to measure the development pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are few scientific tools used to accurately predict development pressure from National Agency in Korea. The first reason is lack of quality data. The data was computerized and archived for a long time, but it was so big and complicated that it was not kept neatly. Lastly, In Korea, we have never studied scientific development pressure by applying time and space at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7QVpndGlfbkNjMVk&#34; alt=&#34;Solution1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7LWZoeW1KcDN5b3c&#34; alt=&#34;Solution2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7MFdpY1MtTzNJVG8&#34; alt=&#34;Solution3&#34; /&gt;
We have developed a development pressure prediction model that has the concept of time and space by normalizing massive amounts of data. The model identifies the impacts between the layers through the hierarchical structure that the land has, and grasps the influence relations between the adjacent regions according to spatial conditions. Next, the model identifies how the above characteristics have changed over time.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7b1BlcDU4amdwczg&#34; alt=&#34;Solution4&#34; /&gt;
The definition of development pressure was defined as &amp;ldquo;the number of land movements&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the number of transactions in land transactions&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;the number of building permits&amp;rdquo; after consultation with practitioner at LH corporation. However, since each number is too large a concept is defined more precisely as seven in above. The independent variables used in the model were about 200 such as area and landmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;result&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7YlJpcEFibzN3eEU&#34; alt=&#34;result1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7Wkc3SElRZTZ4eUE&#34; alt=&#34;result2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7Nk4yUGFCTDlrdlE&#34; alt=&#34;result3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the approximately 200 variables, 168 are statistically significant. Predictability is also excellent. Currently, LH Corporation is considering to use it in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed a model which out-performed original model by 140% AUC-ROC chart basis. Currently, Korean Ministry of National Defense is considering to use it in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Keywords: Machine Learning, Suicide Risk, Military
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-background&#34;&gt;Introduction/Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent soldiers who commit suicide in Korea, various programs are being implemented. According to the results of the psychological examination, if the psychological state of the soldier is determined to be dangerous, the military shall take action accordingly (ie. Send him home).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that many of the personnel who are not identified as dangerous by the psychological examination suicide. As Only about 60% of the suicides were found to be dangerous in psychological tests based on past data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=&amp;amp;confirm=no_antivirus&amp;amp;id=0B2x5sIkwVHb7c2FjU1kzODczYlk&#34; alt=&#34;solution1&#34; /&gt;

We used machine learning to create a predictive model. In addition to traditional research methods, relevant studies are being conducted in the United States to predict through machine learning. In this project, stochastic gradient boosted tree model was used by using psychological inspection data and basic information of soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;result&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h1&gt;
